## Documentation

```

## Programming Languages
### Python
```sh
echo "alias python=/usr/bin/python3" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "alias pip=/usr/bin/pip3" >> ~/.zshrc
```

Install miniforge for apple silicon:
```sh
wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh -O ~/miniforge.sh

sh ~/miniforge.sh -b -f -p  $HOME/.miniforge

rm ~/miniforge.sh
```

Add the following in your .zshrc file:
```sh
if [ -f "$HOME/.miniforge/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
      . "$HOME/.miniforge/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
  else
      export PATH="$HOME/.miniforge/bin:$PATH"
fi
```

Open up a new terminal and the conda command should be available, if you donâ€™t want to activate the base environment run the following:

```sh
conda config --set auto_activate_base false
```

### Node
```sh
brew install fnm

echo '"$(fnm env --use-on-cd)"' >> /Users/chris/.zprofile

fnm install 17
```

### Rust
This should be all you need to install rust.
```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Go
```sh
brew install go
```

I hate that they put a go directory right in my home directory. I personally change the GOPATH like this:

```sh
export GOPATH=$HOME/.local/share/go
export PATH=$HOME/.local/share/go/bin:$PATH
```

then remove the other one:

```sh
sudo rm -rf ~/go
```

## Install Neovim
Neovim is my text editor of choice

I install Neovim from source you can probably just:

```sh
brew install neovim
```

## Rosetta

Rosetta will allow you to run software compiled for x86_64 architecture on Apple silicon.

```sh
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```

## Docker
Follow the instructions at the following link to install docker desktop for Apple silicon.

[docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)

```sh
brew install lazydocker
```

Make sure to stop docker desktop after installing and set it to not auto-start since it is pretty resource hungry.

## Install my dotfiles
```sh
brew install stow
git clone https://github.com/therealalexmois/dotfiles.git
```

## Nerd fonts
```sh
brew install fontconfig
```

Useful gist for install fonts: [font gist](https://gist.github.com/davidteren/898f2dcccd42d9f8680ec69a3a5d350e)

You can also download your own fonts and place them in ~/Library/Fonts
